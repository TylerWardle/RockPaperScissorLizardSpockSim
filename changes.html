	<div class="post-content" itemprop= " articleBody">
	Changed Player to implement Comparable. Player is comparable first by name then by increasing number of players
	
	Added a testComparePlayers() method to TestDriver. This method sorts the players generated by buildPlayersAndTeams()
	making use of the newly implemented Comparable interface of the Player class.
	
	split logic of the testGenerateTeams() method in TestDriver into two methods, buildPlayersAndTeams() and printTeams().
	testGenerateTeams() now calls these two methods. This enables the newly added testComparePlayers() method to use
	the buildPlayersAndTeams() method.
