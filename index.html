Welcome to my landing page for my Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Tournament Application!<br/>
The application simulates a single elimination tournament of RPSLS <br/>
<img src="teacherERD.png"/><br/>
Basically, you can add, remove or update players in the starting bracket <br/>
and when you are ready, play some RPSLS with live and simulated players<br/>
This application is powered by Swing backed by a H2 DB.<br/>
If you wish to see the data persisted to H2, open up the local console after the application has started.<br/>
URL: <a href="http://localhost:8082">http://localhost:8082</a> (H2 will start a server for you)<br/>
and login with the following settings:<br/>
<pre>
Generic H2 (Embedded)
org.h2.Driver
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
blank username and password
</pre>
<hr/>
 Click <a href="rockpaperscissorslizardspocksim.zip">here</a> to download my application.  After you unzip this application into a suitable folder, "cd" into that directory and run:<br/>
<pre>

</pre><br/>
