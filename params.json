{"name":"Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock Sim","tagline":"Play a single elimination tournament of RPSLS with a random number of simulated opponents","body":"Welcome to my landing page for my Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Tournament Application! This application simulates a single elimination tournament of RPSLS.\r\n\r\nBasically, you can add, remove or update players in the starting bracket. When you are ready just press play for some RPSLS with live and simulated players. This application is powered by Swing and backed by a H2 DB. If you wish to see the data persisted to H2, open up the local console after the application has started.\r\n\r\nURL: http://localhost:8082 (H2 will start a server for you) and login with the following settings:\r\n* Generic H2 (Embedded)\r\n* org.h2.Driver\r\n* jdbc:h2:mem:testdb\r\n* blank username and password\r\n\r\nClick [here](http://tylerwardle.github.io/RockPaperScissorLizardSpockSim/rockpaperscissorslizardspocksim.zip) to download my application. After you unzip this application into a suitable folder, \"cd\" into that directory and run:\r\njava -jar rockpaperscissorslizardspocksim-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n\r\nThe code for this project can be found via github [here](https://github.com/TylerWardle/RockPaperScissorLizardSpockSim)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
