Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock simulator or RPSLS
updated July 30, 2014

This application will simulate a single elimination tournament of RPSLS with eight 
initial players. The option of all or no user controlled players with simulated players 
making up the remaining players in a tournament will be available. Simulated players will 
throw random gestures and have a random bias for a certain gesture while live players will
 be prompted for gestures.
