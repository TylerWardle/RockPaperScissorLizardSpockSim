Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock simulator or RPSLS
updated June 2, 2014

This application will simulate a single elimination tournament of RPSLS with a 
random but even number of initial players greater than 2. The option of any number of user 
controlled players with simulated players making up the remaining players in a tournament will 
be available. Simulated players will throw random gestures and have a random bias for a certain 
gesture while live players will be prompted for gestures.
